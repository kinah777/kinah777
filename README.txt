Task Given: Write a Java program to find the sum of digits of a large number using BigInteger.


Purpose of the Program:

	This Java program uses the 'BigInteger' class to determine the total digits of a large number that was read from a text file. It illustrates how to handle exceptions, conduct arithmetic operations on big numbers, and read data from a file based on the instructions given on MS Teams. 

The Approach:

	What I did first was I created an "input.txt" text file that contains a large number that the program reads.
The large number is represented and worked with using the 'BigInteger' class. The software loops over all of the numbers' digits, extracts each one, and adds it to the total. Lastly, the total of the digits is then printed. And I added that if the "File" was not found it would display an error. 

Assumptions on the Program:

	There is just one line in the input file "input.txt" that has one big number on it. I also discovered that the large number can be positive or negative. Also non-numeric input is not handled by the program.

5-step Instructions for Running the Program:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Make sure that the file "input.txt" is in the same directory as the Java source file "Bolante.Shekinah.MidtermReq.java".
3. Open terminal, command prompt, or your preferred IDE.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Java source file and input file.
5. Run the program or if using Terminal you can use this command: java Bolante.Shekinah.MidtermReq

External Libraries or Dependencies:

	If I'm not mistaken, this program only needs regular Java libraries and doesn't require any more libraries beyond the standard Java libraries.
